What wonders can arise when UGC embraces Web3? **Babelyx** , the Babel Tower of infinite possibilities, mints all UGC to Sovereign Contents that autonomously circulate in a Smart Market, increasing every participant's perpetual rewards. Step into **Babelyx** to monetize your contents and earn passive income!

### What is Babelyx?

**Babelyx** is the Babel Tower for everyone and any possibilities.

In the Book of Genesis from the Bible, God created the world and humanity, who then spread across the Earth. One day, ancient humans decided to build **The Tower of Babel** . At that time, everyone spoke the same language and shared a common goal, successfully constructing a towering structure. When the tower was about to reach the heavens, God became fearful and confused their language, causing people to be unable to understand each other and to fight among themselves. Consequently, the tower was never completed and eventually crumbled into ruins.

Argentinian writer Julio Cortázar proposed an imaginary concept in his famous 1941 novella, **The Library of Babel** . This library is a simple yet infinite library containing all possible combinations of letters. In this library, standing at any position and looking around, one would see endless bookshelves composed of countless hexagonal bookcases. Each bookcase contains books where any two adjacent books differ by only one letter. Despite such minuscule differences, if you walk far enough along the bookshelves and take enough turns, you will inevitably find any book you desire. This boundless library contains all languages, all subjects, and all meanings, encompassing the past, present, and all possible futures, waiting to be discovered.

In Eastern Buddhism, there's the concept of the **Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds** , depicting a macro-to-microcosmic structure of the universe. These worlds consist of countless great thousand worlds (Mahāsaha-loka), each containing numerous middle thousand worlds (Madhya-loka), within which exist the six realms of reincarnation. Each middle thousand world houses numerous small thousand worlds (Saha-loka), each with its own heavens, earth, sentient beings, and various forms of existence, possessing unique life, landscapes, and rules. This concept illustrates the vastness and diversity of the universe, where countless worlds, large and small, exist, each with its distinct characteristics and forms of existence, representing the boundless sentient beings in Buddhism.

### What Does Babelyx?

Babelyx mints any UGC into **Sovereign Contents** that autonomously circulate in a **Smart Market** to perpetually increase every participant's **Passive Income**, unleashing infinite possibilities for everyone.

As a user, by making every digital content you get an encrypted sovereign asset and an autonomous store, bringing you continuous revenue forever.

This is made possible by our patented **BLX** technology that seamlessly integrates data security of IPFS, digital ownership of NFTs, and smart contracts of Ethereum, along with powerful AIGC technologies, providing you with an unprecedented experience, rights and rewards.

BLX features:

1. **Safe NFT**
   Since its rise in 2021, NFT technology has garnered significant attention, transforming digital content into unique assets and forging direct, intimate connections between creators, fans, sponsors, and investors. (See [NFTs: Empowering Creators in the Digital World](https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/nfts-and-creators))

   However, NFTs are merely "certificate of ownership of unsafe content". While the certificates themselves are unreplicable and tamper-proof through blockchain technology, the actual content behind NFT is still as vulnerable as traditional internet (Web2) content, lacking privacy protection and being accessible, copyable and even tamperable by anyone. This vulnerability limits the application scenarios of NFT technology, which is primarily only thriving in the digital art domain.

   To solve this problem, we upgrades NFT with safe content, i.e. Safe NFT, by encrypting the actual content in the following steps:

   1. At first the actual content is encrypted in a decentralized manner,
   2. Then, hash addresses of the encrypted content are saved in a certificate that is permanently stored in the IPFS file system,
   3. Finally, the certificate pointing to the encrypted content is minted into an NFT.

   With Safe NFT, the actual content is fundamentally prevented from unauthorized access, copying, distribution, and tampering. For instance, others must pay a decryption fee to the content owner, to be able to access the actual content through a decentralized mechanism.

   Therefore, Safe NFT not only ensures your ownership, but also goes further to unbreakably safeguard your data privacy and security by means of mathematical principles!

2. **Role Pact**
   The Smart Market is facilitated by Role Pact, i.e. a set of smart contracts defining rights and benefits of different market roles. Through Role Pacts, the underlying asset can be traded autonomously among various participant roles. For example:

   - Creator Pact : Once the original creator mints digital content into BLX, it automatically becomes an indelible, unalterable, unique, and permanent mark. In all subsequent appreciation of this asset, the original creator will automatically receive corresponding returns according to the contract.
   - Visitor Pact : Sets a decryption fee for visitors. A user who pays the decryption fee becomes an "accessor," able to decrypt and access the digital content.
   - Buyer Pact : Sets a purchase fee for buyers. A user who pays the purchase fee becomes a "holder," owning a certain share of the asset. Holding rights apply to limited-supply shared assets such as book copies, movie tickets, membership statuses, restaurant seats, rental time slots, etc. Users can transfer their limited slots, promoting sharing, circulation, and appreciation.
   - Owner Pact : Records the current owner of the asset and the buyout price for full ownership. Other users can acquire the asset by purchasing it outright, becoming the new owner. Each asset can only belong to one owner at any given time. The access, holding, rental, and other revenue from the asset are enjoyed by its current owner.
   - Additional pacts : Beyond these roles, assets can have more detailed or extended roles such as agents, operators, renters, and more.

   Thus, Role Pact turns user content to a perpetual self-running store. Without owner intervention, the asset can circulate and appreciate among different user roles, providing long-term stable income for creators and maintaining high enthusiasm for various user types.
