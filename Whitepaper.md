### What means Babelyx?

**Babelyx** is the Babel Tower of infinite possibilities, realizing everyone's potential.

In the Book of Genesis from the Bible, God created the world and humanity, who then spread across the Earth. One day, ancient humans decided to build **The Tower of Babel** . At that time, everyone spoke the same language and shared a common goal, successfully constructing a towering structure. When the tower was about to reach the heavens, God became fearful and confused their language, causing people to be unable to understand each other and to fight among themselves. Consequently, the tower was never completed and eventually crumbled into ruins.

Argentinian writer Julio Cort√°zar proposed an imaginary concept in his famous 1941 novella, **The Library of Babel** . This library is a simple yet infinite library containing all possible combinations of letters. In this library, standing at any position and looking around, one would see endless bookshelves composed of countless hexagonal bookcases. Each bookcase contains books where any two adjacent books differ by only one letter. Despite such minuscule differences, if you walk far enough along the bookshelves and take enough turns, you will inevitably find any book you desire. This boundless library contains all languages, all subjects, and all meanings, encompassing the past, present, and all possible futures, waiting to be discovered.

In Eastern Buddhism, there's the concept of the **Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds** , depicting a macro-to-microcosmic structure of the universe. These worlds consist of countless great thousand worlds (MahƒÅsaha-loka), each containing numerous middle thousand worlds (Madhya-loka), within which exist the six realms of reincarnation. Each middle thousand world houses numerous small thousand worlds (Saha-loka), each with its own heavens, earth, sentient beings, and various forms of existence, possessing unique life, landscapes, and rules. This concept illustrates the vastness and diversity of the universe, where countless worlds, large and small, exist, each with its distinct characteristics and forms of existence, representing the boundless sentient beings in Buddhism.

### What Can Babelyx Do?

Babelyx mints any UGC into **Sovereign Contents** that autonomously circulate in a **Smart Market** to perpetually increase every participant's rewards, unleashing infinite possibilities for everyone.

As a user, by making every digital content you get an encrypted sovereign asset and an autonomous store, bringing you continuous revenue forever.

This is made possible by our patented **BLX** technology that seamlessly integrates data security of IPFS, digital ownership of NFTs, and smart contracts of Ethereum, along with powerful AIGC technologies, providing you with an unprecedented experience, rights and rewards.

BLX features:

1. **Safe NFT that enables sovereign contents**
   Since its rise in 2021, NFT technology has garnered significant attention, transforming digital content into unique assets and forging direct, intimate connections between creators, fans, sponsors, and investors. (See [NFTs: Empowering Creators in the Digital World](https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/nfts-and-creators))

   However, NFTs are merely "certificates of ownership authenticity". While the certificates themselves are unreplicable and tamper-proof through blockchain technology, the digital content behind NFT is still as vulnerable as traditional internet (Web2) content, lacking privacy protection and being accessible, copyable and even tamperable by anyone. This vulnerability limits the application scenarios of NFT technology, which is primarily only thriving in the digital art domain.

   Our BLX technology upgrades NFT to next level by securing the actual content, henceforth BTXs are "existence proofs of encrypted NFT content", or Safe NFTs. It first encrypts the actual content in a decentralized manner, permanently storing it in the IPFS file system, then mints it into an NFT, thus fundamentally preventing unauthorized access, copying, distribution, and tampering of the actual content. Others must pay a decryption fee to the content owner to access the actual content through a decentralized mechanism.

   Therefore, Safe NFT not only ensures your ownership authenticity, but also goes further to unbreakably safeguard your data privacy and security by means of mathematical principles!

2. **Role Pact that enables the smart market**
   BLX enables a smart market by Role Contracts. Each BLX inherently includes multiple smart contracts, each defining a role's rights, enabling the underlying asset to support various participant roles and engage in decentralized transactions anytime, anywhere. For example:

   - Creator Pact : Once the original creator mints digital content into BLX, it automatically becomes an indelible, unalterable, unique, and permanent mark. In all subsequent appreciation of this asset, the original creator will automatically receive corresponding returns according to the contract.
   - Visitor Pact : Sets a decryption fee for visitors. A user who pays the decryption fee becomes an "accessor," able to decrypt and access the digital content.
   - Buyer Pact : Sets a purchase fee for buyers. A user who pays the purchase fee becomes a "holder," owning a certain share of the asset. Holding rights apply to limited-supply shared assets such as book copies, movie tickets, membership statuses, restaurant seats, rental time slots, etc. Users can transfer their limited slots, promoting sharing, circulation, and appreciation.
   - Owner Pact : Records the current owner of the asset and the buyout price for full ownership. Other users can acquire the asset by purchasing it outright, becoming the new owner. Each asset can only belong to one owner at any given time. The access, holding, rental, and other revenue from the asset are enjoyed by its current owner.
   - Additional pacts : Beyond these roles, assets can have more detailed or extended roles such as agents, operators, renters, and more.

   Thus, the multi-role smart contract operates like a perpetual self-running store. Without owner intervention, the asset can circulate and appreciate among different user roles, providing long-term stable income for creators and maintaining high enthusiasm for various user types.

3. **AI-Assisted Creation**
