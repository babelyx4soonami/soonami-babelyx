# Babelyx - Smart Market of Soverein Contents

What wonders can arise when UGC embraces Web3? **Babelyx** , the Babel Tower of infinite possibilities, mints all UGC to Sovereign Contents that autonomously circulate in a Smart Market, increasing every participant's perpetual rewards. Step into **Babelyx** to monetize your contents and earn passive income!

### What is Babelyx?

**Babelyx** is the Babel Tower for everyone and any possibilities.

In the Book of Genesis from the Bible, God created the world and humanity, who then spread across the Earth. One day, ancient humans decided to build **The Tower of Babel** . At that time, everyone spoke the same language and shared a common goal, successfully constructing a towering structure. When the tower was about to reach the heavens, God became fearful and confused their language, causing people to be unable to understand each other and to fight among themselves. Consequently, the tower was never completed and eventually crumbled into ruins.

Argentinian writer Julio Cortázar proposed an imaginary concept in his famous 1941 novella, **The Library of Babel** . This library is a simple yet infinite library containing all possible combinations of letters. In this library, standing at any position and looking around, one would see endless bookshelves composed of countless hexagonal bookcases. Each bookcase contains books where any two adjacent books differ by only one letter. Despite such minuscule differences, if you walk far enough along the bookshelves and take enough turns, you will inevitably find any book you desire. This boundless library contains all languages, all subjects, and all meanings, encompassing the past, present, and all possible futures, waiting to be discovered.

In Eastern Buddhism, there's also the concept of **Three Thousand Great Thousand Worlds** , depicting a macro-to-microcosmic structure of the universe. These worlds consist of countless great thousand worlds (Mahāsaha-loka), each containing numerous middle thousand worlds (Madhya-loka), within which exist the six realms of reincarnation. Each middle thousand world houses numerous small thousand worlds (Saha-loka), each with its own heavens, earth, sentient beings, and various forms of existence, possessing unique life, landscapes, and rules. This concept illustrates the vastness and diversity of the multi-universe, where countless worlds, large and small, exist, each with its distinct characteristics and forms of existence, representing the boundless sentient beings in Buddhism.

### What Does Babelyx?

Babelyx mints any UGC into **Sovereign Contents** that autonomously circulate in a **Smart Market** to perpetually increase every participant's **Passive Income**, unleashing infinite possibilities for everyone.

As a user, by making every digital content you get an encrypted sovereign asset and an autonomous store, bringing you continuous revenue forever.

This is made possible by our patented **BLX** technology that seamlessly integrates data security of IPFS, digital ownership of NFTs, and smart contracts of Ethereum, along with powerful AIGC technologies, providing you with an unprecedented experience, rights and rewards.

BLX features:

1. **Safe NFT**
   We all know that what you post on the internet does not truly belong to you, but rather to social media oligopolies like Facebook, TikTok, X, and others. Your influence and earning are entirely reliant on the traffic allocation at their interests. Content censoring, surveillance, blockade, or outright banning can happen on these centralized platforms at the whim of their operators .

   This is why Web3 emerged. However, Web3 applications have not yet gained widespread user adoption and traction, likely due to the inherent complexity of current Web3 technologies and a lack of compelling user-oriented scenarios.

   Since its rise in 2021, NFT technology has garnered significant attention, transforming digital content into unique assets and forging direct, intimate connections between creators, fans, sponsors, and investors. (See [NFTs: Empowering Creators in the Digital World](https://learn.metamask.io/lessons/nfts-and-creators))

   However, NFTs are merely "owner certificate of unsafe content". While the certificates themselves are unreplicable and tamper-proof through blockchain technology, the actual content behind NFT is still as vulnerable as traditional internet (Web2) content, lacking privacy protection and being accessible, copyable and even tamperable by anyone. This vulnerability limits the application scenarios of NFT technology, which is primarily only thriving in the digital art market.

   To resolve these pain points, we upgrades NFT with safe content, to become Safe NFT, by encrypting the actual content in the following steps:

   1. At first the actual content is encrypted in a decentralized manner,
   2. Then, hash addresses of the encrypted content are saved in a BLX certificate that is permanently stored in the IPFS file system,
   3. Finally, the BLX certificate pointing to the encrypted content is minted into an NFT.

   With Safe NFT, the actual content is fundamentally prevented from unauthorized access, copying, distribution, and tampering. For instance, others must pay a decryption fee to the content owner, to be able to access the actual content through a decentralized mechanism.

   Therefore, Safe NFT not only ensures your ownership, but also goes further to unbreakably safeguard your data privacy and security by means of mathematical principles!

2. **Role Pact**
   The Smart Market is facilitated by Role Pacts, that are smart contracts defining rights and benefits of different market roles. Through Role Pacts, the underlying asset can be traded autonomously among various participant roles. For example:

   - Creator Pact : Once the original creator mints digital content into BLX, it automatically becomes an indelible, unalterable, unique, and permanent mark. In all subsequent appreciation of this asset, the original creator will automatically receive corresponding returns according to the contract.
   - Visitor Pact : Set a decryption fee for visitors. A user who pays the decryption fee becomes an "accessor," able to decrypt and access the digital content.
   - Holder Pact : Set a purchase fee for buyers. A user who pays the purchase fee becomes a "holder," owning a certain share of the asset. Holding rights apply to limited-supply shareable assets such as book copies, movie tickets, membership statuses, restaurant seats, rental time slots, etc. Users can transfer their limited slots at new prices to other holders, promoting sharing, circulation, and appreciation.
   - Owner Pact : Record the current owner of the asset and the buyout price for full ownership. Other users can acquire the asset by purchasing it outright, becoming the new owner. Each asset can only belong to one owner at any given time. The access, holding, rental, and other revenue from the asset are mainly enjoyed by its current owner.
   - Additional pacts : Beyond these roles, assets can have more detailed or extended roles such as agents, operators, renters, and more, just like in the real-world.

   Thus, Role Pacts turn user content to a perpetual self-running store. Without stakeholders' intervention, the asset can circulate and appreciate among different market roles, providing long-term stable income for stakeholders and maintaining high enthusiasm for various user types.

3. **AI-Assisted Creation**
   Have you ever been stuck in a creative rut, unable to find inspiration despite racking your brains? Don't worry, our AI assistant is always on standby, providing a wisdom-filled inspiration booster. With AI's creative assistance, you will continuously spark new ideas, connecting seemingly unrelated dots into the most brilliant pictures, bringing words to life on paper and making videos more vivid and moving.

After some content is minted, it becomes a **Babelyx creation** that consist of following parts:

- A Babelyx certificate: a plain text file in IPFS containing the Safe NFT and Role Pacts.
  - Safe NFT: this certificate's hash address as the NFT's token id.
  - Role Pacts: rules for each role's credentials and entitlements.
- The actual content: multiple files for text, image, video, etc. in the content.
